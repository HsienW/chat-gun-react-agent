description: MUST be considered at task start in this repository to detect OpenSpec change lifecycle work and route it to token-efficient stage prompts. Use when the user asks Codex to plan, review, implement, fix, readiness-check, archive, or coordinate an OpenSpec change, especially with CCR/Qwen/Codex handoffs.

# OpenSpec Workflow Router

Use this skill as a routing layer. Do not load every reference. Pick one stage, then read only its reference file.

## Task-Start Awareness

At the start of every task in this repository:

1. Decide whether the request belongs to the OpenSpec change lifecycle.
2. If a change name is known, read only `.agent-runtime/<change-id>/current-state.json` even though `.agent-runtime/` is ignored.
3. If CurrentState exists, use `currentPhase` as the source of truth and verify `currentOwner`; reject a conflicting requested stage.
4. Select exactly one stage and read only that reference.
5. Read only artifacts named by `latestArtifactRefs` or the current Handoff `requiredInputRefs`.
6. If CurrentState is missing, only CCR may initialize it during `plan-change`; every other role or stage must stop.
7. If it is not a lifecycle task, keep the context policy below in force and continue with the normal project rules.
8. If another host owns the stage, produce the handoff prompt or perform only the requested role.

## Context Policy

- Prefer user-provided summaries, diffs, verification results, and named files.
- Read the minimum relevant OpenSpec artifacts and adjacent code/tests.
- Do not scan the whole repo by default.
- Ignore files and directories ignored by `.gitignore`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, and lockfiles unless dependency changes are in scope.
- Expand context only for contract conflicts, security concerns, unclear architecture, or test failures that cannot be localized.
- Keep all user-facing output in Traditional Chinese.

## Runtime Artifact Boundary

Before reading an ArtifactReference, verify changeId/runId, reject `..` and absolute paths, require an `openspec/changes/` or `.agent-runtime/` prefix, confirm the file exists, and stop if it contains a Secret or Credential. Never glob or recursively scan `.agent-runtime/`.

Each stage reference defines Input, Output, and State Transition. Structured JSON is the machine-readable source; Markdown is an equivalent human-readable projection.

## Route Table

| User intent | Stage | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create or evaluate a new change plan | `plan-change` | `references/01-plan-change.md` |
| Review proposal / design / tasks before implementation | `review-plan` | `references/02-review-plan.md` |
| Implement an approved OpenSpec change | `apply-change` | `references/03-apply-change.md` |
| Review Codex implementation result | `review-result` | `references/04-review-result.md` |
| Fix issues from Qwen review | `fix-from-review` | `references/05-fix-from-review.md` |
| Decide whether a change is ready to archive | `readiness-check` | `references/06-readiness-check.md` |
| Archive the change and draft commit message | `archive-change` | `references/07-archive-change.md` |

## How To Use

1. Identify the stage from the user request.
2. Read exactly one matching reference first.
3. Follow that reference's prompt or workflow.
4. If the reference asks for project rules, read only the relevant sections/files.
5. If the user asks for a prompt, output the prompt. If the user asks to execute, perform the stage.

If the stage is ambiguous, ask one concise Traditional Chinese question instead of loading multiple references.
