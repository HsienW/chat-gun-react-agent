# OpenSpec Workflow Router

Use this skill as Qwen Code's read-only routing layer for the repository OpenSpec multi-agent workflow.

## Task-Start Awareness

At the start of every task in this repository:

1. Decide whether the request belongs to the OpenSpec change lifecycle.
2. If a change name is known, read only `.agent-runtime/<change-id>/current-state.json`.
3. Treat `currentPhase` as the source of truth and verify `currentOwner` is `Qwen` for review work.
4. Select exactly one stage and read the matching canonical Codex reference.
5. Read only `latestArtifactRefs` and current Handoff `requiredInputRefs`; validate changeId/runId, safe paths, existence, and absence of Secrets.
6. For review stages, load `secondary-architecture-reviewer`.
7. If CurrentState or required evidence is missing, output `INCOMPLETE`; never initialize or modify state.
8. If it is not a lifecycle task, keep the context policy below in force and continue with `QWEN.md`.

## Context Policy

- Prefer user-provided summaries, diffs, verification results, and named files.
- Read the minimum relevant OpenSpec artifacts and adjacent code/tests.
- Do not scan the whole repo by default.
- Ignore files and directories ignored by `.gitignore`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, and lockfiles unless dependency changes are in scope.
- Expand context only for contract conflicts, security concerns, unclear architecture, or test failures that cannot be localized.
- Keep all user-facing output in Traditional Chinese.
- Maintain Qwen's read-only boundary from `QWEN.md`.
- Never recursively scan `.agent-runtime/`, read another Change/Run, or write Runtime Artifacts.

## Route Table

| User intent | Stage | Qwen action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create or evaluate a new change plan | `plan-change` | Review capability boundary only if asked; otherwise ask CCR to plan. |
| Review proposal / design / tasks before implementation | `review-plan` | Use `secondary-architecture-reviewer` on OpenSpec artifacts. |
| Implement an approved OpenSpec change | `apply-change` | Do not implement; ask Codex to use apply-change. |
| Review Codex implementation result | `review-result` | Use `secondary-architecture-reviewer` on diff, artifacts, and validation evidence. |
| Fix issues from Qwen review | `fix-from-review` | Do not edit; provide findings and minimum fix direction. |
| Decide whether a change is ready to archive | `readiness-check` | Provide read-only residual-risk and verification assessment if asked. |
| Archive the change and draft commit message | `archive-change` | Do not archive; review readiness or ask Codex/human to archive. |

## How To Use

1. Identify the stage from the user request.
2. Read only the artifacts needed for that stage.
3. Follow `QWEN.md` and `.qwen/skills/secondary-architecture-reviewer/SKILL.md` for reviewer output.
4. If the stage is ambiguous, ask one concise Traditional Chinese question.

For review stages, emit a schema-valid `review_result` to stdout. Human or CLIHost validation and persistence must complete before CurrentState advances.
